Hi,

There are two bash scripts for a total of 4 simulations. 
replace scratch folder of NS3 with this one, navigate to that folder in the terminal and run:

chmod +x up1down2.sh
chmod +x up2down1.sh

To enable the bash scripts as executable. And to actually execute and run the simulation navigate to the scratch folderrun

./up1down2.sh
./up2down1.sh

Enjoy!
